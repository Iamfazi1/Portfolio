</div>

Hey! I'm Faizan, and in this project, I'm gonna build a hands-on malware lab where I manually analyze malware step by step like a proper SOC analyst. Sure, platforms like [Any.Run](https://any.run) exist where you just upload the malware and everything is visualized for you — super cool stuff.

**BUT**, I'm not gonna take the shortcut. I'm doing all of this manually to better understand how malware behaves in the real world, and how to detect and defend against it. 😤🔥

## 🎯 What I'm Gonna Do

</div>

* Set up a virtual machine 💻
* Put a log collector inside it 📥
* Start Wireshark for full packet capture 🌐
* Add file integrity monitoring 🛡️
* Then... download a virus from MalwareBazaar and execute it 💀
* And finally, observe what it's doing to my system and what's changing 🕵️

Everything I learn, capture, and analyze — I'll document and publish it right here in this repo so other learners like me can benefit too. 💪

## 🔥 Why Not Just Use Any.Run?

[Any.Run](https://any.run) is amazing. Upload a malware sample, and it shows you the process tree, network connections, dropped files — all automatically.

But that’s *too easy*. I want to:

* Capture raw packets myself using Wireshark
* Track processes with Procmon and Sysmon
* Log and analyze everything manually
* Create real reports like a threat hunter would

So yeah, I'm doing it the **hardcore way**. 😤

## 🛠️ Tools I’m Gonna Use

| Purpose          | Tool                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| VM Host          | VirtualBox or VMware                       |
| OS               | Windows 10 (Target) + Kali (Optional)      |
| Log Collection   | Sysmon + Winlogbeat/Wazuh Agent            |
| Packet Capture   | Wireshark                                  |
| File Integrity   | OSSEC / Wazuh / Tripwire                   |
| Malware Analysis | Procmon, Autoruns, Process Hacker, Regshot |
| Documentation    | Markdown, GitHub, Screenshots              |
| Malware Source   | [MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/)  |

## 📁 Folder Structure (GitHub Layout)

Here's how I'm organizing this whole repo:

```
malware-analysis/
├── README.md
├── <sample-virus-name>/
│   ├── preparation/
│   │   ├── vm-setup.md
│   │   ├── tools-installation.md
│   │   └── safety-checklist.md
│   ├── analysis/
│   │   ├── process-logs.md
│   │   ├── network-capture.md
│   │   └── filesystem-changes.md
│   ├── detection/
│   │   ├── sysmon-analysis.md
│   │   ├── mitre-mapping.md
│   │   └── iocs.md
│   └── report/
│       └── final-report.md
```

Each sample I test will have its **own folder** inside the `malware-analysis/` root folder. In that sample folder, I'll break things down by stage — from setup to final reporting.

## 🧠 Steps I'm Gonna Follow

### 1. 🛠️ Preparation

* Create a VM (no shared folders, USB, etc.)
* Take clean snapshots for rollback
* Install tools like Sysmon, Wireshark, Wazuh, etc.

### 2. 💾 Download Sample

* Download sample from MalwareBazaar
* Record SHA256, name, malware family

### 3. 🔥 Execute & Monitor

* Run the malware sample
* Start full packet capture
* Track file, registry, and process changes

### 4. 🕵️ Detect & Analyze

* Review Sysmon and other logs
* Analyze PCAPs
* Use MITRE ATT\&CK to classify techniques

### 5. 📑 Report Everything

* Use markdown to document observations
* Extract Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
* Write a full malware analysis report

---

## 🚀 Final Goal

* Learn malware behavior in detail
* Get better at using detection tools
* Show off my malware analysis skills in my GitHub portfolio

Follow along as I go from setup to detection, one sample at a time. I’ll keep this README updated and add links to each virus folder as I finish them!
