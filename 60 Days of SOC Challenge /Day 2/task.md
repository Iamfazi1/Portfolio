In this task, I explored the basics of analyzing Windows Security Logs using the built-in Event Viewer. The goal was to understand how logon events are recorded and how they can help detect suspicious activity.

This task focused on:

- Accessing and navigating the Event Viewer
- Understanding common Windows Security Log Event IDs
- Observing logon activities (Event ID 4624 and 4625)
- Recognizing useful log fields such as Logon Type, Account Name, Source IP, and Process Name

Tools/Components used:

- Windows Event Viewer
- Windows Security Log Channel
- Event ID 4624 (Successful logon)
- Event ID 4625 (Failed logon)
