<p align="center">
  <b>Hands-on Blue Team Journey — One Task a Day, Every Day, for 60 Days</b>
</p>

---

### 👋 Welcome!

This challenge is my personal journey of becoming a better SOC Analyst — not through theory, but through **real-world, hands-on practice**.

Each day, I perform 1–3 tasks that a SOC analyst does in their job.  
It includes:

- 🔍 Log analysis  
- 📈 SIEM queries  
- 🚨 Alert triaging  
- 🐞 Malware sample review  
- 📊 Report creation  
- 🛠️ Tool usage and scripting  
- ✅ AND documentation of everything I do

---

### ⚠️ Authenticity Disclaimer

> **All tasks here are original, done by me (Faizan), from scratch — no copy-paste portfolios, no AI dump.**
>
> I commit daily, and each task includes:
> - My custom scripts or code
> - Personal notes, thoughts, and learnings
> - Screenshots, outputs, or analysis

Feel free to explore the commits and folders — my work speaks louder than words!

---

Each day contains:
- 📄 A detailed description of what I did
- 🧠 Notes on what I learned or fixed
- 💻 Code or commands used
- 🖼️ Evidence (logs, screenshots, results)

---

### 🎯 Goal

To build a **real-world SOC analyst portfolio** that:
- 🧠 Shows my blue team skills
- 💼 Impresses recruiters & hiring managers
- 🔐 Proves I understand SOC workflows
