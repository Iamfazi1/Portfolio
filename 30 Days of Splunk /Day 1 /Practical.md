## 🔍 Task Overview
Today's mission was simple: **get into Splunk and run your very first search**. No complex queries, no filters — just pure data exploration. The idea was to get familiar with the Splunk interface and understand how to pull events using the `index=*` query, and then narrow it down using `| head 5`.

And yes, I actually did it. Here's proof 👇

### 🔹 `index=* | head 5`
> Because I wasn’t trying to read *all* the logs like a psycho. Just five. Calm down.

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

Let’s keep going. Day 2 is up next. 🔥
